			<h1>Third Hand Information</h1>
			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to Third Hand Information – personal website
			of Reidar Djupvik</p>
			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am a 31 year old web developer living in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands; and I'm
			currently looking for work.</p>
			<h2>About this website</h2>
			<p>I've owned this domain name for quite some time, and I always
			meant to do something more with it. I figure that if you are a web
			developer, you'd have your own personal web space. My ideas for the back-end
			always turn into this framework monstrosity, and until that is done (sure...) this
			is a work in progress.</p>
			<p>Currently, this is all I've got, but I'm planning on making this
			website into a bilingual (Norwegian and English) blog about web development
			(and anything else I'd like to talk about on my personal blog). Stay tuned&hellip;</p>
